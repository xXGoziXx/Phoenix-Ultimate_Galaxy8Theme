# Phoenix - Ultimate Galaxy 8 Theme
A customized theme using UxTheme Patcher that I made for Windows 8/8.1.


#### Disclaimer:
This _Theme Pack_ is **only** for *Windows 8/8.1* Devices. It is **not recommended** for *Windows 7*. **Do not** try it for *Windows 7* unless you *know* what you're doing.
I am not responsible for any damage caused to your device in the process of following this guide.
(Then again if you follow this guide exactly you *shouldn't* cause any harm to your PC/Laptop/Tablet etc.)

#### Instructions:
 1. Open the "**_UxStyle Patcher for Windows 8 or later_**" folder.
   Install the application "**_UxStyle_sep23_x86_x64.exe_**".
 2. Once they have finished installing place the folder "**_Ultimate_**" into *C:\Windows\Resources\Themes* (*where C: is the drive your local disk is on*)

   For those that are new to placing files in system directories:  
   Copy "*C:\Windows\Resources\Themes*" (*not including the inverted commas.. obviously* **:D**).  
   Open a new **_File Explorer_** window and paste what was copied into the *address bar*.  
   Then copy the "**_Ultimate_**" folder(*again ...not including the inverted commas* **:D**) from the _Theme Pack_ and paste it in the new **_File Explorer_** window.
 3. Then open the "**_Phoenix Ultimate - Galaxy_**" (*from the Theme Pack folder*)

**Enjoy the awesome looking theme!!**
